I'd only used an iPhone before so I wasn't sure about getting used to an android operating system but now I prefer it. I love having a back button! I love being able to move the cursor where I want it. I like the size of this, not too big or small. I read a lot of ebooks and its weight is good. I immediately put a tech armor screen protector and devicewear case on it to protect it. Sometimes my camera won't work but if I restart the device than it works again fine.

Google the problem and you will see it is a widespread issue experienced by hundreds. Asus won't acknowledge the issue. I ended up sending it in just to get the repair estimate and submitted that to American Express which automatically added a year to the warranty when I bought it. I then used the claim money to buy parts on eBay and got it working again. One month later it failed for another common issue. The touch screen became jumpy and unresponsive. Piece of junk I've wasted too much time on. A shame because I really liked it at first. My dealings with ASUS resulted in a complete loss of confidence with the company. Although some of their products have good reviews (even this one, amazingly), I now avoid ASUS products completely because I'm not willing to roll the dice with them again. If ASUS had acknowledged the problem, fixed defective units, and released a revision, it would have cost them a trivial amount of money. It would have been the right thing to do. Instead, they are writing off customers as a less expensive loss.\\n\",\n",
